1. Geographical and Temporal Consistency: Checking for consistency in traffic origins and access times. Legitimate traffic often follows predictable patterns related to the geographic location of users and the times when they are active.
    2. Typical Application Behavior: Understanding how applications are typically used, including request patterns and user interactions. Traffic that deviates significantly from these patterns without a clear reason may warrant investigation.
    3. Protocol Compliance: Ensuring that traffic follows expected protocol behaviors. Many DDoS attacks exploit or violate protocol standards, so traffic that adheres to these standards is less likely to be malicious.
    4. High Request Rates: A high rate of requests over a short period, especially if concentrated on specific targets within the network, often signifies an attempt to overwhelm resources.
    5. Geographic Irregularities: Traffic originating disproportionately from certain locations, especially regions not typically associated with the normal user base, may suggest a coordinated attack.
    6. Protocol Anomalies: Traffic that does not adhere to expected protocol patterns, including malformed packets or unusual TCP/UDP request ratios, can indicate malicious activity.
    7. Repeated Access Requests: Repeated requests for the same resource or endpoint within a short timeframe, particularly if they result in errors or failed attempts, might be part of an attack.
    8. Behavioral Anomalies: Patterns that do not match the expected behavior of legitimate users or systems, such as navigating a website in a way that no normal user would, can signal an attack.
    9. Payload Anomalies: Unexpected or malicious payload in network packets, designed to exploit vulnerabilities or cause disruptions, can be part of a DDoS strategy.
    10. Low-and-Slow Attack Indicators: Unlike volumetric attacks, some DDoS attacks aim to exhaust resources slowly over time. Detecting these requires monitoring for slow, persistent traffic that is abnormal but might not immediately stand out.
